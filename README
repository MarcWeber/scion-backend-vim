scion-backend-vim
=================

IMPORTANT:
  The current branch has been started to adopt the current code to the new
  multiple workers architecture of scion. See scion branch scion-2nd-attempt docs/*
  
  If you need to know the current state of the update contact me (see bottom of file).

This is the vim backend belonging to the http://github.com/MarcWeber/nominolo/scion project (branch ressurect-vim)

Some features such as show type at cursor are not present in the new architecture yet.

Usage:

Put into your .vimrc:

let g:scion_config = {}
let g:scion_config.scion_server_path = 'path-to-scion-server'

make sure that scion-worker is in PATH

:ScionCreateSession

Then you should get a list of errors in quickfix.
The quickfix list should be updated automatically on buf write.

if you have trouble or errors have a look at the server log by
:ScionServerLog

Still trouble? See contact at the bottom

## VIM troubleshooting:

  * Check python version:

    " Does your vim support Python?
    :echo "expected: 1, got: ".has('python')

    " which version?
    :py import sys
    :py print "python version should be >= 2.4, your python version is:\n \n%s"%sys.version


      Vim mode requires Python support (version 2.4 or later).  Vim 7.2 or
      later has Python support enabled by default.  However, not every
      distribution of Vim includes a recent enough version of Python.
      Notably, MacVim is only linked against version 2.3.5 to be compatible
      with OS X 10.4.  You will need to build it from source, which is
      however reasonably fast.


  * Is your ~/.vimrc read? Try:

    :echo g:scion_connection_setting

    If you see red lines you pasted the configuration into the wrong file.
    See :h .vimrc

  * ~ ($HOME) expansion: use expand("path") or expand("$HOME").'/rel-path'

  * For testing purposes you can source all .vim files this way:
    "source <scion-backend-vim-home>/vim_runtime_path/plugin/haskell_scion.vim

    However there should be no reason to do so!
